chest pain at rest patient was recently admitted and underwent stress test which was negative for ischemic area of disease patient was placed on heparin gtt for cardiac catherization which revealed that the svg to om1 was completed occluded proximally the decision was made not to place a stent since it appeared to be an old occlusion days and his initial troponions and mb were negative and there were no ischemic changes on ekg the plan was to optimize medical management with imdur renexa bid atorvastatin metoprolol aspirin and then continue to have discussion with outpatient cardiologist regarding further management however the patient began to have rising troponins on several hours after the catherization and then went into pea arrest and required intubation and transfer to the ccu for management ccu course patient underwent pea arrest in the evening of the patient developed sudden onset respiratory distress and ams he subsequently suffered a pea arrest with cpr performed and rosc after 5min cta ruled out pe but showed small rul consolidation vs compressive atelectasis and a moderate r pleural effusion at the time of transfer to the ccu the pt was on levophed for hypotension in the evening of eveloped fever and was ordered for ctx to treat uti due to a positive urinalysis the urine culture eventually grew enterococcus sensitive to vanc and unasyn on the pt remained febrile and vancomycin was added unasyn was added on for possible aspiration pneumonia he continued to spike fevers up to daily so he also received a dose of cefepime on and a dose of azithromycin on on id was consulted and recommended discontinuation of all antibiotics given likelihood of drug fever rather than an infectious etiology the patient had no further fevers after the pt was increasing agitated on the vent and unable to arouse when sedation weaned so he underwent evaluation by neurology with concern for anoxic injury an mri showed evidence of several foci of small embolic strokes eeg c w toxic metabolic encephalopathy the pt was noted to have bloody secretions on during suctioning at this time the pt s fever curve increased with a tm of sputum cx revealed gpcs on gram stain and given concern for aspiration ctx was d c and unasyn was initiated bloody secretions increased in quantity on and and the pt was evaluated by pulmonology who felt that they were related to irritation by the et tube compounded by anticoagulation and possible pneumonia on unasyn was broadened to cefepime the ccu team was unable to wean him from mechanical ventilation for several days due to the patient s inability to follow commands even off sedation as well as periods of agitation and tachypnea with low tidal volumes on he was noted to be alert and following commands he was eventually able to be extubated on post extubation the patient was awake talking and mostly responding to commands and interacting with his family the following day he was talking to his family members and calling them by name talking about distant past events appropriately overall he appeared to be dramatically improved towards the evening of however he was restless agitated more paranoid would not sleep despite his family urging by his agitation had worsened and the ccu team needed to give frequent doses of antipsychotics to help control this they discontinued his foley on overnight he required ongoing antipyschotics olanzapine haldol and seroquel and was even tried on precedex between 6pm and 6am without good effect of note the patient had a fever to in the am of his last fever prior to this was when antibiotics were discontinued and was straight catheterized yielding 300cc with a ua that was abnormal wbcs epi though ucx was negative he also was hypoxemic to mid 80s off nasal cannula mid 90s on nc lastly at 30am his pupils were noted to be unequal so a stat neuro consult was obtained their assessment was that this was most likely due to medication effect from ipratropium anticholinergic and albuterol beta agonist nebulizers this morning as well as precedex alpha agonist ct head was ordered which did not reveal any acute intracranial hemorrhage or infarct

red blood cell count abnormal liver enzymes and nodules below the skin on your forehead we evaluated your liver and head and found lesions we were concerned were cancer that had spread from your liver we took images of your head and torso with a ct scanner and confirmed that the lesions likely represented cancer we also found another mass in your left adrenal gland and some lymph nodes in that area we then evaluated you with an mri of your brain which showed aneurysms outpouchings of your vessels you were seen by neurosurgery who did not recommend any urgent intervention but asked you to make an appointment in clinic when you leave the hospital a ct scan of your head also showed a mass on your spine that was concerning for compression of your spinal cord so the radidiation oncology team saw you and began radiation on those spinal masses to shrink them you were seen by the oncology team who made an appointment for you to see them when you leave the hospital to discuss prognosis and

hospitalization from to for sepsis with dic complicated by limb ischemia from pressors and dic as well as multiple other complications during which endocrinology was consulted for hypercalcemia hypothyroidism and adrenal insufficiency he has been re admitted for a planned limb amputation which took place on the patient has now been transferred to medicine for further management of fungemia and pseudomonas uti since being on the medicine service he had a seizure as well as cultures positive for fungemia and subsequent hap history of strep bacteremia with limb ischemia s p amputation the patient developed ischemic limbs secondary to purpura fulminans as a sequelae of strep pneumo bacteremia and pressor shock the patient was admitted for and underwent a four limb amputation on the patient had epidural and supraclavicular blocks performed and was continued on a ketamine gtt as well as dilaudid iv and oxycodone prn the pain service was consulted and per their recommendations the patient s gabapentin and methadone were increased and he was continued on oxycodone to mg q4h prn and hydromorphone to mg q2h prn for severe pain per plastics and vascular surgery the patient s ketamine was discontinued on and the epidural was removed on the patient was transferred out of the icu without issue hospital acquired pneumonia versus recurrent uti in the setting of up trending leukocytosis low grade fevers and softer pressures a cxr was done on showing a new lll opacity c f infection pna given the patient s prolonged hospitalization he was diagnosed with hap and his ciprofloxacin was discontinued and he was broadened to zosyn of note the patient developed eosinophilia and seizure while on a cephalosporin which is why zosyn was chosen he was continued on vancomycin a ucx was drawn at the same time and returned as vre just after discharge although it is not completely clear patient actually had a uti rather than just colonization particularly since his wbcs improved with addition of zosyn it was thought prudent to change vancomycin to linezolid so the discharging attending called over to inform the receiving attending of the above and to give a detailed warm handoff intermittent hypotension primary adrenal insufficiency the patient was intermittently hypotensive during his hospitalization when trying to taper his steroids his hypotension is most likely multifactorial but largely due to his primary adrenal insufficiency his lactate was normal when checked during hypotensive episodes the patient received multiple ivf boluses of note his

his month old child was cheating on him in this setting patient reported he became acutely distraught with days of insomnia low mood poor appetite attempting to hang himself with a belt in his house which he shares with his girlfriend and her family on my interview patient currently denies depressed mood anxiety nvs on examination and states that his suicide attempt was a means to obtain his girlfriend s attention mse notable for a well groomed cooperative man with good eye contact denial of all depressive symptoms and thought process that is notably linear logical goal and future oriented diagnostically etiology of presentation seems most consistent with adjustment disorder with depressed mood with improvement of depression in the setting of reported resolution of conflict with his girlfriend no evidence on my examination to suggest a current depressive episode he is not dysthymic or dysphoric on examination although i am concerned he may be minimizing his current symptoms and appears euthymic denies symptoms of anxiety and denies si or thoughts of self harm nothing in his history to suggest a history of manic symptoms and he is certainly not manic on my examination denies history of psychotic symptoms and nothing on examination that is concerning for acute psychosis given young age and good health underlying medical condition is unlikely to be playing a role in his presentation likewise given denial of substance use and negative tox screen i do not believe that alcohol or substance use is a factor in his presentation legal safety patient

was counseled regarding indications to return to care pain pt has been requiring iv dilaudid for management of r forearm pain and has had emesis examined by rns that has precluded her from tolerating po medications yesterday it was brought to my attention that on two separate occasions the rn put up a bag of diluted dilaudid minibagged programmed a rate and subsequently discovered that the rate had somehow changed to deliver the medication more quickly i spoke with the rn and we agreed that in the future she would request that another rn accompany her when programming the rates to verify that an error had not been made overnight different rn with whom i spoke directly programmed her pump to deliver minibagged dilaudid then turned around to document then reportedly heard the keys being pressed on the pump she turned around and noted that the rate had been significantly increased the pt stated that the pump had malfunctioned i felt that the best approach was to advise ms of the goal to taper off of iv opioids as quickly as possible given the possibility that her rlq pain represents narcotic bowel syndrome see below i offered dilaudid iv minibagged at decreasing frequency at this point she stated that the only pain relief to date had been from iv dilaudid boluses we discussed the pharmacokinetics including rapid onset of dilaudid administered in these forms and i explained that under these circumstances boluses were not indicated i offered to involve the chronic pain consult service she somewhat hesitantly agreed pain service was consulted and advised discontinuation of all iv opioids with transition to oral agents followed by a taper off of opioids shortly after this discussion another dose of dilaudid iv minibagged was set up and two rns verified the rate they both returned several minutes later and both confirmed that the dilaudid bag was empty prematurely immediately after this observation the patient called for assistance and was found undressed on the floor of the bathroom she stated that she had fell unclear whether or not there was loc neurologic exam was assessed and without deficits at this time in the presence of and rn i expressed my concerns that the dilaudid appeared to have been infused faster than the rate programmed by rns and that under these circumstances i was not comfortable administering any additional iv pain medications ms communicated her frustration at having been blamed the medical team contacted patient relations and sw over the following hours after extended discussions i met with the patient together with sw rns and given above i offered to explore alternative approaches to pain medication including non iv non po given reports of ongoing emesis formulations of opioids as a transitional modality patient continued to express her frustration and distrust of the medical team i attempted to validate her frustration and explore opportunities to restore her trust in my ability to provide the best possible

episodes explaining tath she was a super go and would sometimes crash she also endorsed a history of paranoid ideation regarding peers and coworkers although generally resistant to engaging with the treatment team she remained in behavioral control and did not require any physical or chemical restraints additionally she consistently denied si hi and never exhibited any violent or dangerous behaviors towards herself or others patient did endorse anxiety and depressed mood associated with stressors at work but otherwise remained very future oriented throughout admission on collateral information from father corroborated a long history of unstable relationships volatility mania and paranoia in school the patient was reportedly seen by teachers as perceiving that other girls did not like her patient reportedly got into trouble with these children as a result initially parents thought other children may have been mistreating the patient but they expressed that they had since realized that the paranoid ideation has been unfounded and has left the patient isolated with regard to personal and professional relationships father also noted periods during which the patient felt very high and periods when she crashes and becomes depressed father also noted that the pattern of paranoid ideation regarding coworkers especially has persisted into adulthood and he also corroborated pattern of taking on more projects and responsibilities during periods of elevated mood as a result she has not always been able to finish said projects which has led to problems with

outpatient setting additionally the patient was hesitant to consent to a family meeting with her parents and cousins and ultimately she allowed for her father and cousins to attend explaining that her mother had a great deal going on including caring for an elderly parents having a child in college and recently burying the family dog on the family meeting with father and cousin with patient and treatment team did not go well the patient was verbally abusive to cousin and father and refused to allow further communication with family however at no point was the patient unsafe or did she exhibit any dangerous behaviors on the patient reiterated that she was ready to go so as to move forward with interviews for other biotech companies the patient again brought up her fmla paperwork and was redirected to the psychiatrist to whom she has been given a referral also the patient remained resistant to feedback from the treatment team regarding her unwillingness to engage in treatment she continued to express that she would fully engage in comprehensive outpatient treatment the patient continued to be evasive in answering questions and when confronted with this behavior she explained i
